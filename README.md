# ☕ Coffee Machine Simulator

Welcome to your very own command-line café, where the espresso is instant, the latte never spills, and the cappuccino is just a few keystrokes away.  
Built in Python. Served by code. Powered by caffeine (not yours though, we don’t take responsibility for that energy).

Made with no actual coffee beans by **Unnathi** 👩‍💻

## 🧾 The Menu

Pick your potion:
- `espresso` – $1.50 (strong and mysterious)
- `latte` – $2.50 (creamy and classic)
- `cappuccino` – $3.00 (frothy drama)

Just type your order and watch the magic happen.  
Also responds to secret commands like:
- `report` – see what's left in the coffee tank
- `off` – shuts the machine down for a nap 💤

## 💰 How Coin-tastic!

This machine accepts:
- Quarters (25¢)
- Dimes (10¢)
- Nickels (5¢)
- Pennies (1¢)

Insert the right amount or more. If you're generous (or just bad at math), we give you change!  
If not… no drink for you 😔

## 🧠 What It Does

✔ Checks if there's enough milk, water, and coffee  
✔ Asks you to insert coins  
✔ Calculates change  
✔ Makes your coffee (digitally)  
✔ Tracks how rich you are getting from all this (profit counter!)  
✔ Politely declines if resources are low (sad beep noises not included)
